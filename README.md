1.	 Introduction
1.1.	Problem Statement
The toll plaza collection system will be useful to the user who travel through the tolls by paying the amount to the tolls before head for the journey for a particular toll or for all tolls from one place to destination. First the user will give the travelling details of vehicle number, vehicle type and the destination. After the travelling details the user will give toll details of for which toll the user want to pay or for all tolls and the user can pay amount for single trip or return trip also available. If the user paid for the tolls, then at the tolls the payment will be verified using rfid scanner (qr code)

1.2.	Motivation
The motivation for this project is that as we can see that so many people are traveling in their vehicles. As we traveling, we can find the number of toll gates on the way. We find it very difficult to wait in the queue for such a long time. At present, manual toll collection is the most widely used collection method in the world. Due to manual intervention, the processing time at toll plazas is highest. Traffic congestion at Toll plazas leads to a huge economical loss in terms of fuel wastage and also causes pollution.

1.3.	Objective
This system reduces cash handling which aids in enhanced audit control by user account.
It will help to reduce the waiting time at the tolls.
It provides users the flexibility of paying their toll amounts with both rfid and from account.
User can pay amount to the tolls before head for the journey.
User can pay amount to the tolls from one destination to another destination.
